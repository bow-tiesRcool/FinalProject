This is a Silent Hill PT clone. But instead of having the same thing every
playthrough, it is randomly generated everytime. So no playthrough is ever 
the same.

I found a new Enemy. I found most of the sounds for the game. Made a new Door
Controller. made some more Hallways.

Make monster thing do things like run at you, disappear, walk into a room, 
stand still until you look at it, and close the doors. Make more Animations, and 
Hallways.
