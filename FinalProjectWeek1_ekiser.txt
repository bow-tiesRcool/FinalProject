This is a Silent Hill PT clone. But instead of having the same thing every
playthrough, it is randomly generated everytime. So no playthrough is ever 
the same.

I have found all the game assets that I will Prolly use for the game. Made a 
generic prefab of the hallway to easily created different hallways. I made a
couple of animations for the lights. Created some scripts to iterate through
an array of objects and play the animation on them.

I plan on making some more hallways and find some sounds effects to make the 
game more "live." Create a Audio manager to play the sounds with distance. Make
monster thing do things like run at you, disappear, walk into a room, stand still
until you look at it, and close the doors.
